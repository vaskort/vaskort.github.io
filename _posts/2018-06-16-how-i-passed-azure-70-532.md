title: How to pass the Microsoft Azure 70-532 certification
---

Microsoft has a few certifications for Azure and one of them is the "70-532 Developing Microsoft Azure Solutions" which is mainly targeted for developers. I will try to make a breakdown of the steps I followed that helped me pass the exam.

### Get the latest updated for the exam

All the Azure certifications get updated very often (every 3 months approximately) so go to [Microsoft Azure page](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/learning/exam-70-532.aspx) and search for "Exam 532 change document". You will then find the link that links to the pdf with the latest changes.

### Play with Azure Portal and pick your course!

You obviously have to learn your way around [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/). It can be quite overwhelming in the beginning, especially if you haven't use it at work before but there are two courses that might help you.

The first one is this course from Udemy: [Azure Course](https://www.udemy.com/70532-azure/). I paid Â£10 for this course so I suggest you to wait when its on sale again (or maybe delete your cookies?:wink:). Try to follow what the instructor does, as himself suggests many times throughout the course, play with the available options, create different services, break things! There are some videos from the course by the instructor on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gnLwSI4d9E&list=PL6cactdCCnTJnzwSAIKl9RZvzORVdRcdO) so you can try before you buy.

Another very helpful course was this one from Pluralsight: [https://app.pluralsight.com/paths/certificate/developing-microsoft-azure-solutions-70-532](https://app.pluralsight.com/paths/certificate/developing-microsoft-azure-solutions-70-532). The instructor goes into much detail and is very thorough, I only watched the 4th section (Implement Web and Mobile Services on Microsoft Azure) and it really helped. On the plus side, you'll get free online exam test with your pluralsight subscription (check the image below).

*Don't forget to revisit the change document because some of the sections of the courses has might have been removed from the actual exam*.

### Book your exam date

I know, even after completing the Udemy course you don't feel like you can pass the exam and that's true! But if you have an exam date set, it will keep your motivation high and it will stop you from procrastinating your study. And don't worry you can always reschedule for free 5 days before the exam and push back your exam date.

At this point after you finished the Udemy course I believe you can be ready to pass the exam in 1 - 1,5 month if you study around 15 hours per week, that's how it worked for me.

Go again to the [Microsoft Azure 70-532 page](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/learning/exam-70-532.aspx) and schedule your exam! I picked the slightly more expensive option (~180 pounds) which gives you the option for a free retake and an online test preparation from [MeasureUp](https://www.measureup.com/). To be fair, I only did the first section (Virtual Machines) of the MeasureUp exam and I found it really helpful.

### Watch the exam preparation video from Microsoft

The exam preparation video will help you identify the key points where you should focus more. This can be extremely helpful as you're getting closer to the exam date.

### Practice!

Now its time to practice with online tests either with the Kanplan test or the one from MeasureUp. 

It can be very overwhelming if you practice the full exam with random questions so what worked great for me was to practice each section separately. Choose to get questions only from the first section and only go to the second one when you reach 70%. When you finish the 4th section repeat the process as many times as you feel comfortable.

Also don't forget to choose the option to "Show Answer Explanation" so whenever you give the wrong answer you can read the explanation right away and follow the links for further study. 

The answer explanations is maybe the most important thing in your preparation because not only it will help you answer similar questions but also they give you a broader context which can be really helpful.

### You're ready!

At this point you should be ready to pass the exam. The only thing you have to do is to be well rested on the day of the exam because its quite a long one (it was 3 hours for me). 

Some feel it's a lot of time but it depends how quickly you're going to answer as the case study questions might take a while (one case study took me 30 minutes to answer!).

I really hope you found this guide helpful and good luck!
