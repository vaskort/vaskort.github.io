### About me

Hi, I'm Vasilis, a front-ender from Athens, Greece currently based in London.  

### More Information

Lately I have been working mostly with React and automated testing, both unit and end-to-end but I still enjoy doing heavy JS/HTML/CSS work.

I have 4 years of commercial experience working with the latest front-end technologies, delivering fully responsive, cross platform and multi-browser compatible solutions.

I'm currently working for [ASOS](http://www.asos.com/) as part of the Content Platform Team and in my free time I enjoy playing the guitar and trying to stay fit.
