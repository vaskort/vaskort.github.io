### About me

Hi, I 'm Vasilis, a front-ender from Athens, Greece currently based in London.  

Lately, I enjoy being active on GitHub where I recently created a simple jQuery plugin for responsive tables, [respTables](https://github.com/vaskort/respTables) and other stuff as well.

### More Information

I have more than 2 years of commercial experience working with the latest front-end technologies, delivering fully responsive, cross platform and multi-browser compatible solutions.

I 'm currently working for [Hopster](http://hopster.tv/) and in my free time I enjoy studying music and playing the guitar.
