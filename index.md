### About me

Hi, I'm Vasilis, a front-ender from Athens, Greece currently based in London.  

### More Information

I enjoy building beautiful UIs with React and sometimes working on the server with Node.

I have 6+ years of commercial experience working with the latest front-end technologies, delivering fully responsive, cross platform and multi-browser compatible solutions.

I'm currently working for [ASOS](https://www.asos.com/) as part of the Web Team and in my free time I enjoy playing the guitar and trying to stay fit.
