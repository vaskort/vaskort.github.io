# About me

Hi, I’m Vasilis, a Front-end Engineer from Athens, Greece, currently based in London.

I specialize in building beautiful, responsive UIs with React, and I occasionally work on the server side with Node.js. With over 10 years of experience, I’ve worked with the latest front-end technologies, delivering fully responsive, cross-platform, and multi-browser compatible solutions.

I’m currently part of the Web Team at [ASOS](https://www.asos.com/) and a member of [Toptal](https://toptal.com/BrAoOV/worlds-top-talent)'s freelance network. In my free time, I enjoy playing the guitar and staying fit.

For more info about me, check the links below or feel free to get in touch!
